# Project-P3-Item-Catalog

Project Description:

This repository contains a sample app that I put together and has all the requirements asked to complete
in Project 3 for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

It's a website that enables user can post items for sale or giveaways, registrations is done using only a
social ID so it implements OAuth1 and OAuth2, Does not retain any passwords or implements a user accounts
database, it will only store an ID used so it can relate to the items sold.

I've used a very easy to implement authentication and authorization python library :
Authomatic http://peterhudec.github.io/authomatic/index.html
Also to manage the login session I've used LoginManager from Flask.

What does this example achieve :

It passes al the requirements asked for in 'Project-P3-Item-Catalog' final project :
 - Implements JSON endpoints and Atom feeds with AtomFeed.
 -
